# SkillSwap – Local Skill Exchange Marketplace

SkillSwap is a community-driven platform that enables users to exchange skills using time-based credits instead of money. The system promotes inclusivity, local collaboration, and fair access to services by valuing skills based on time rather than currency.

## Project Overview

Users can offer and request skills within their local area by creating profiles that include skills, location, and availability. Each user receives a digital credit wallet where one credit equals one hour of service. Skills are displayed through a location-based interface, allowing users to discover nearby providers easily.

A matchmaking system ranks skill providers based on relevance, distance, availability, and trust score. After a successful skill exchange, credits are transferred securely, and both users submit reviews to maintain platform reliability.

## Key Features

- User registration and profile management

- Skill listing and local discovery
